The initial commit:

###### FUNCTIONALITY
- It's a simple card matching game. A player can flip two cards in one turn. If they match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip over again.
- The game has implemented functions of game raiting (3 to 1 start, when 3 is a win with the least count of moves), tracking a time from start to winning the game and restarting the game.
